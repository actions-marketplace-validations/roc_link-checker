# Broken link checker action üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Find broken links in your website.

This action uses the node based [broken-link-checker](https://github.com/stevenvachon/broken-link-checker) and is heavily based on [the lychee link checker action](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action) and [celinekurpershoek's link checker action](https://github.com/celinekurpershoek/link-checker).

## How to use

Create a new file in your repository .github/workflows/find-broken-links.yml.

### Add link checking on push

You can pass in any of the options availible in the [broken link checker cli](https://github.com/stevenvachon/broken-link-checker/blob/main/lib/cli.js#L549-L570)

```yml
name: Broken link check
on: [push]

jobs:
  broken_link_checker_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Check for broken links
    steps:
      - name: Check for broken links
        id: link-report
        uses: roc/link-checker@master
        with:
          url: {WEBSITE_LOCATION}
          blc_args: --verbose --exclude github --follow false # can be any blc args
          allow_failures: true # do not fail the job if broken links are found
      - name: Get the result
        run: |
          echo "steps.link-report.outputs.exit_code was:" ${{steps.link-report.outputs.exit_code}}
          echo "cat ${{steps.link-report.outputs.report}}"
          cat ${{steps.link-report.outputs.report}}
```

### Create a ticket when a broken link is detected

You may not want to fail a job when broken links are detected. This can be achieved by passing `allow_failures: true` and adding an additional action step:

```yml
name: Broken link check with issue creation
on: [push]

jobs:
  brokenLinks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Check links, Create issue
    steps:
      - name: Check for broken links
        id: link-report
        uses: roc/link-checker@master
        with:
          url: "https://github.com/roc/link-checker"
          # important: https://fooasldn.com/ comes back as BLC_ROBOTS without follow=true
          blc_args: --verbose --exclude github --follow true
          allow_failures: true
          output_file: yeah/blc/out.md

      - name: Create Issue From File
        uses: peter-evans/create-issue-from-file@v4
        # See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-conditions-to-control-job-execution
        if: ${{ steps.link-report.outputs.exit_code != 0 }}
        with:
          title: Link Checker Report for github.com/roc/link-checker
          content-filepath: ${{steps.link-report.outputs.report}}
          labels: report, automated issue
```

## workflow inputs

This workflow takes blc options as `blc_args` but has some additional inputs:

```
  url:
    description: "Url of site"
    required: true
    default: "https://github.com/roc/link-checker"
```

```
  allow_failures:
    description: "Pass the job even if the link checker finds broken links"
    required: false
    default: false
  output_file:
    description: "Summary output file path"
    default: "blc/out.md"
    required: false
```

The output file generated is attached to the workflow report and can be passed to a subsequent step to raise an issue.
